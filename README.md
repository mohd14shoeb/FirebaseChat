# FirebaseChat
This project follows the tutorial at [Lets build that app](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuP2vJ6kRutQBfRmdcI92mA) of Brain Voong. Build an chat app with the Firebase 3 backend. It's a really useful tutorial for experienced iOS developers. 

In the tutorial, Brian used Swift 2.3, I started this on October, so that I used Swift 3. 

The greatest thing I learnt from Brian is he just uses Auto layout programmatically. Incredible. 

[Ep1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWSc0wHFTXM&list=PL0dzCUj1L5JEfHqwjBV0XFb9qx9cGXwkq&index=1):  Build the login controller with Constraint Anchors. You can take a lot at my Youtube clone (followed another tutorial) to see my notes. There are some useful note here. Something is extend UIColor init, start app programmatically.
